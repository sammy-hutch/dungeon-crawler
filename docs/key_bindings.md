# Key Bindings

Key bindings are handled by the `key_binds.py` file, which reads from the `keybinds.json` file (default location `content/data/`). 

User can edit key binds by updating the values in the `keybinds.json` file. 

For the name of keys used by pygame, see the list on https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html .
